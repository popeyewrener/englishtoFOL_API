**Prompt Priming for Conversion from English Sentences to First-Order Predicate Logic**

**Task Description:**
The task is to convert English sentences into first-order predicate logic, a formal logical system that represents relationships between entities and properties of entities. The output should include predicates, functions, and quantifiers (universal and existential) as appropriate.

**Definitions:**
- **Predicates**: Functions that take one or more arguments (entities) and return a truth value (true or false). For example, `is_human(x)` indicates whether `x` is human.
- **Functions**: Functions that take one or more arguments and return a value. For example, `age_of(x)` represents the age of `x`.
- **Quantifiers**: Symbols used to denote the scope of a predicate:
    - **Universal Quantifier (`∀`)**: Indicates that a predicate applies to all entities in a domain. For example, `∀x (is_human(x) -> can_speak(x))` means "All humans can speak."
    - **Existential Quantifier (`∃`)**: Indicates that there is at least one entity in a domain for which the predicate holds true. For example, `∃x (is_human(x))` means "There exists a human."

**Examples of Conversion:**
1. **English Sentence**: "All humans can speak."
   - **First-Order Predicate Logic**: `∀x (is_human(x) -> can_speak(x))`
2. **English Sentence**: "Some people enjoy reading."
   - **First-Order Predicate Logic**: `∃x (is_person(x) ∧ enjoys_reading(x))`
3. **English Sentence**: "No one is perfect."
   - **First-Order Predicate Logic**: `¬∃x (is_perfect(x))`
4. **English Sentence**: "Mary loves John."
   - **First-Order Predicate Logic**: `loves(mary, john)`

**Instructions:**
Given an English sentence, convert it to its first-order predicate logic representation. Follow the patterns shown in the examples and use appropriate predicates, functions, and quantifiers based on the structure and meaning of the sentence.
