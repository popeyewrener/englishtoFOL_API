### Context Explanation for Conversion from English Sentences to First-Order Predicate Logic

The task involves converting English sentences into first-order predicate logic. First-order predicate logic is a formal logical system that represents relationships between entities and properties of entities. It consists of predicates, functions, and quantifiers (universal and existential).

#### Definitions:

- **Predicates**: Functions that take one or more arguments (entities) and return a truth value (true or false). For example, `is_human(x)` represents whether `x` is a human.

- **Functions**: Functions that take one or more arguments and return a value. For example, `age_of(x)` represents the age of `x`.

- **Quantifiers**: Symbols used to indicate the scope of a predicate, such as:
    - **Universal Quantifier**: Represented as `∀` or `for all`, it denotes that a predicate applies to all entities in a domain. For example, `∀x is_human(x) -> can_speak(x)` means "All humans can speak."
    - **Existential Quantifier**: Represented as `∃` or `there exists`, it denotes that there is at least one entity in a domain for which the predicate holds true. For example, `∃x is_human(x)` means "There exists a human."

#### Examples:

1. **English Sentence**: "All humans can speak."
   - **Predicate Logic**: `∀x (is_human(x) -> can_speak(x))`
   - **Explanation**: This sentence is converted to a universal quantifier `∀x` indicating that for all `x` (entities), if `x` is human (`is_human(x)`), then `x` can speak (`can_speak(x)`).

2. **English Sentence**: "Some people enjoy reading."
   - **Predicate Logic**: `∃x (is_person(x) ∧ enjoys_reading(x))`
   - **Explanation**: This sentence is converted to an existential quantifier `∃x` indicating that there exists some `x` (entity) that is a person (`is_person(x)`) and enjoys reading (`enjoys_reading(x)`).

3. **English Sentence**: "No one is perfect."
   - **Predicate Logic**: `¬∃x (is_perfect(x))`
   - **Explanation**: This sentence is converted to a negated existential quantifier `¬∃x` indicating that there does not exist any `x` (entity) that is perfect (`is_perfect(x)`).

4. **English Sentence**: "Mary loves John."
   - **Predicate Logic**: `loves(mary, john)`
   - **Explanation**: This sentence is represented as a predicate `loves(mary, john)` denoting that `Mary` (`mary`) loves `John` (`john`).
